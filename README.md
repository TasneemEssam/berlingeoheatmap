Electric mobility is essential in order to reduce emission of green house gases. In
recent years sales and usage of electric vehicles has accelerated significantly. However
lack of electric charging stations in many areas remains impediment for further success.
Based on geovisualization of different datasets referring to Berlin we want to analyze
demand for additional electric charging stations.
In general, areas with large population and low number of charging stations have demand
for more of them. Furthermore large number of one-family-houses reduces demand, because
owners of electric car install charger on their private property. However reliable and
free data about ratios of housing types is not or only partly available.
